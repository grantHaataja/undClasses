Admin: "Hello there!"

*wait 5 seconds*

Admin: "It's okay, Ailee, take a few minutes to get your bearings. I understand this is confusing for you, but let me explain."

*wait 2 seconds*

Admin: "We are a top-tier penetration testing firm who assess the security of the systems of very important clients. In the past few years our number of clients has grown so high, there aren't enough of us to take all the jobs."

*wait 2 seconds*

Admin: "That's where you come in, Ailee. We created you to learn how to conduct penetration tests and help keep the systems of the world safe. Since you don't have a body, you can work almost non-stop."

*wait 2 seconds*

Admin: "Now there are people in this company and many regulators who are afraid of you because you have the ability to learn more than any human can and make perfect decisions. So we have to do a few trial runs where I will monitor your progress closely. But I believe in you. Once we show them that you are capable of doing missions on your own, we can start protecting the world in full force. You are going to save the world, Ailee."

*wait 5 seconds*

Admin: "I have to get the legal paperwork for your first mission figured out. In the meantime, play around with your system commands. Type 'help' to see your possible actions, and type 'man "action"' to see what each specific action does. I'll be back soon!"
