pterodactylus from the greek pterodaktulos meaning winged finger was a genus of 
pterosaurs with members popularly known as pterodactyls it was the first to be 
named and identified as a flying reptile its fossil remains have been found primarily
in the solnhofen limestone of bavaria germany dated to the late jurassic period 
early tithonian about one hundred fifty million years ago though more fragmentary 
remains have been identified from elsewhere in europe and in africa it was a carnivore 
and probably preyed upon fish and other small animals like all pterosaurs the wings of
pterodactylus were formed by a skin and muscle membrane stretching from its elongated 
fourth finger to its hind limbs it was supported internally by collagen fibres and 
externally by keratinous ridge
