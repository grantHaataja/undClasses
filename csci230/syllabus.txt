MATERIALS:
1) TEXTS:    Memory as a Programming Concept in C and C++ (Franek) 
             System Programming with C and Unix (Hoover)

2) HARDWARE: TBD

3) SOFTWARE: gcc on Linux Mint machines (Leonard Hall 110 and 112). You may 
             develop programs using other computers, but all labs and 
             homeworks must compile and run properly on Linux Mint!

4) ERRATA:   http://wiki.cs.und.edu/

PURPOSE: This class will be an introduction low level and advanced C 
         programming. The goal for this course is for the student to become 
         proficient in memory management, using pointers, compiling and 
         linking, and the development of libraries. 

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
At the end of this class, students will be able to:
1) Write a program in C that uses dynamic memory and pointer-based data 
   structures.
2) Write and use Makefiles.
3) Create and use static, shared, and dynamic libraries.
4) Understand code optimization.
5) Understand buffer overflows and code injection.

	Final Exam				

GENERAL:

1) Exams will only be given at the scheduled times unless prior arrangements 
   have been made. 

2) Regular attendance is expected and students are responsible for any/all 
   material covered in class.

3) All assignments are due on the assigned dates (by midnight). No 
   late assignments are accepted without prior written approval. 

4) Grading: 1 midterm,    100 points.
            1 final,      100 points.
            Homework,     10+ points each. 
	      Quizes,     5   points each.

            A=100-90%, B=89-80%, C=79-70%, D=69-60%, F=59-0%. 
                                  
5) Plagiarism: You are expected to write your own assignments. In any/all cases 
   of plagiarism the grade for that assignment will be zero for all persons 
   involved. However, I do encourage students to discuss and work together on 
   labs and assignments. But, do not copy solutions, programs, or code fragments 
   from other students. USE OF MY SOLUTION IS ALSO PLAGIARISM!!! All cases of 
   plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of students.

6) If you plan to request disability accommodations in this course, you are 
   expected to register with Disability Services for Students, McCannel Hall, Rm 190,
